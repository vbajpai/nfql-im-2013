There can be a situation where the query designer may incorrectly ask for
aggregation on a field already specified in a grouper (or filter) clause. If
the relative operator is an equality comparison, the aggregation on such a
field becomes less useful, since the members of the grouped record will always
have the same value for that field. \ac{NFQL} realizes this redundant request
and ignores such aggregations.

\ac{NFQL} has dedicated comparator functions for each type of operation and
the type of the field offset it operates upon. It is not guaranteed that given
the type of the query and trace, the program will eventually go through each
stage of the pipeline. It is also possible that the program exits before,
because there is nothing more for the next stage to compute. The function
pointers are therefore set as late as possible and are called from their
respective stages just before the comparison is needed.

Each stage of the processing pipeline is dependent on the result of the
previous one. As a result, the stages should only proceed, when the previous
returned results. Implementing such a response was straightforward for the
grouper and group filter, the merger although was a little trickier.  The
merger stage proceeds only when every branch has non-zero filtered groups.
The iterator initializer deallocates and returns \texttt{NULL} if any one
branch has $0$ filtered groups.  Consequently a check is performed in the
merger to make sure \texttt{iter} is \emph{not} \texttt{NULL}.

The flow-records echoed to the standard output can also be written as
\texttt{flow-tools} files. In fact, results from each stage of the pipeline
can be written to separate files with the increase in the verbosity level.
This leads to additional loops over the resultsets if the writes are made at
the end of the processing pipeline. The execution engine therefore writes each
result record to a file as soon as it is seen by the pipeline stage.
