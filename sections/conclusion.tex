We presented \ac{NFQL}, an efficient C implementation of the stream-based flow
query language. The language allows applying absolute (or relative) filters,
aggregating flows into groups, evaluating intricate timing relationships among
them, and merging them into one collection. \ac{NFQL} can execute such complex
query tasks in matter of minutes, thereby expanding the scope of current flow
record processing tools. The conducted performance evaluations reveal that
\ac{NFQL} is on par with tools that support only absolute filters. SiLK, the
only package that provides tools that are similar to the rest of \ac{NFQL}'s
processing pipeline appears faster. This is because it can optimize its
operations in favor of the limited set of comparisons that are only based on
equality, and its usage of a proprietory file storage format.
