The \texttt{nfql} architecture primarily consists of a front-end parser backed
up by an execution engine as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:nfql-pipeline}. The
execution engine is the brain of \texttt{nfql} where the complete pipeline is
processed. It receives the flow query at runtime using a JSON \cite{rfc4627}
intermediate format. The execution engine is written in C, however the
front-end parser can be written in any desired language.
