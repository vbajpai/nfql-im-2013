Review 1:
- wrong track
- lack of description of the language
- too many implementation details
- metrics used
- research questions and conclusions

Review 2:
- Gigascope, point to the original NFQL paper

Review 3:
- Explain that NFQL is defined elsewhere, this paper is discussing
  implementation aspects.
- Discuss storage requirement vs. state requirement (after all NFQL
  is a streaming language but it requires state to be maintained)

Review 4:
- Explain what NFQL can do that other tools can't do
- Clarify the order splitter/filter in the query language and the
  order of filter/splitter in the implementation
